# INFO 5100 Application Engineering and Development



## FINAL PROJECT



### Objective:

The objective of this final project is to design and implement a software system that addresses a complex, real-world problem. The focus is on constructing a digital platform that serves as a communication and coordination system between specialists (user/employee) and administrative personnel. Your project should encompass multiple entities, such as enterprises, organizations, departments, administrators, suppliers, and individual users.



### Project Overview:

The class will be divided into groups of 2 to 3. Each team will develop a Java application that facilitates interaction among different entities in a specific application domain. You are encouraged to choose a domain that interests you, such as healthcare, logistics, education, e-commerce, supply chain management, etc. The system should simulate real-life workflows. The system can involve communication between two enterprises or organizations and should support four distinct roles (for example, two administrative and two non-administrative roles).

The software must be built using Java Swing (or an alternative) for the user interface, with proper integration of a database for data persistence.



### Deliverables:

1. **Use Case Diagram:**
*A diagram capturing the interactions between actors and the system. Clearly identify use cases and demonstrate how different roles engage with the platform.*

2. **Class Diagram:**
*A diagram representing the structure of the system, showcasing classes, relationships, attributes, and methods.*

3. **Java Swing Application (or alternative):** *A fully functioning Java application that meets the following criteria:*
	- **Ecosystem Scale:** Must include the participation of at least two enterprises/organizations.
	- **Role Implementation:** Include four roles (e.g., two administrative and two regular users), each with distinct permissions and functionalities.

4. . **Project Presentation:** *Prepare a presentation detailing the following aspects of your solution:*
	- **Problem Definition:** Clearly state the problem your project aims to solve.
	- **Stakeholders:** Identify the players involved (e.g., companies, roles) and explain their contributions to the solution.
	- **Use Cases and Design:** Outline key use cases, design decisions, and implementation techniques.
	- **Value Explanation:** Explain how each enterprise and role contributes to solving the problem and delivering value.
	- **Demonstration:** Showcase how the solution effectively addresses the identified problem.



### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Timely Submission:** *Ensure that all deliverables are submitted on time.*

2. **Demo and Presentation Quality:** *Present your solution clearly, demonstrating functionality and the flow of operations.*

3. **Problem Statement Clarity and Relevance:**
	- Clearly define the problem you intend to solve.
	- Demonstrate how your solution effectively addresses the problem.
	- Show collaboration between multiple parties in solving the identified problem.
4.  **Work Request Implementation:**
	- Implement at least two work requests between enterprises and at least a total of four work requests in the entire system.
	- *(Work Request: Functional operations that change the system state, e.g., CRUD operations, data visualization, role-specific actions)*

5. **Bug-Free Operation:** *The application must be error-free and perform all required operations without crashing.*

6. **Database Integration:**
	- Integrate your application with a database.
	- Ensure that data is properly stored, retrieved, and updated based on user interactions.

7. **Presentation Questions:** *Answer related questions during the presentation.*

### Canvas Submission Details:

**Phase 1**
1. Project summary (1-page document describing the topic and the project) due 19th October.

**Final Submission**
1. Entire Project code
2. Presentation ppt (use case diagram, class diagrams, and other relevant information, etc.)

*You may include screenshots of the running project in your presentation if required.*


### Tips for Success:

- **Think Big:** Try to simulate real-world interactions on a small scale. This will help make your project more relatable and impressive.
- **Be Creative:** Select a domain you are passionate about. Projects that reflect personal interest often stand out.
- **Plan Well:** Start by creating diagrams and discussing workflows with your teammates before coding.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure the application is tested for bugs and issues before the demo day.
